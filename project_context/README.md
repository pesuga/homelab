## 🧠 Session State Strategy

The `SESSION-STATE.md` file is our **long-term memory**. It is not just a status report; it is a **decision log**.

**For Agents:**
1.  **Start of Session**: Read the "Current Status" and the last entry in "Session Log" to understand where we left off and *why*.
2.  **During Session**: If you make a significant architectural decision (e.g., "Switching from Ollama to LlamaCpp"), note it down mentally.
3.  **End of Session**: Append a new entry to the "Session Log" using the template below.

**Template:**
```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] [Time] - [Session Title]
**Goal**: [1-line goal]

#### 🧠 Decisions & Rationale
- **[Decision]**: [What changed?]
  - **Why**: [Context/Reasoning]
  - **Alternatives**: [What did we reject?]

#### 🛠️ Changes
- [Service/Component]: [Brief change summary]

#### 📝 Reflections
- [What worked/failed?]
```

If you are an AI agent joining this project, please read:
1.  `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the lay of the land.
2.  `NETWORKING_STANDARD.md` to avoid breaking connectivity.
3.  `REPO_STRUCTURE.md` to know where to write code.
