// Workflow
1. When you think you are done with setup and implementation for a request, please test it using either curl or checking app logs.
2. If test fails please fix the issue and repeat step 1.
3. If test is successful, please update the todo list and README file.
4. Since this repo is an infrastructure repo, after making changes, please test every service to ensure they are still working.
