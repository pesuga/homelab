// Workflow
1. When you think you are done with setup and implementation for a request, please test it using either curl or checking app logs.
2. If test fails please fix the issue and repeat step 1.
3. If test is successful, please update all required files [readme, project management, dashboards, probes, ingress rules, etc].
4. Since this repo is an infrastructure repo, after making changes, please test every service to ensure they are still working.

// Database Operations
5. Before executing any operations that will delete or reset a database, always ask for explicit approval.
6. Always create a backup of a database before attempting any potentially destructive operations.

// Code Management
7. If you can avoid it, please avoid creating scripts to fix issues, I would prefer to edit the files directly and reconcile flux or run kubectl commands in the chat. no more scripts if posible.
8. Scripts should be created as helpers, but all final configurations must be properly committed to the repository structure.
